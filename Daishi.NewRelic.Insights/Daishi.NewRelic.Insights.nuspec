    <description>New Relic Tools for .NET is an unobtrusive New Relic logging-service, designed to run as a background task in ASP.NET, or Windows applications. It currently supports New Relic Insights, is fully asynchronous, and proxy-aware.</description>
    <summary>New Relic Tools for .NET provides features such as uploading events to New Relic Insights on-the-fly, as well as caching events for background batch-upload, at regular intervals. It consumes a single thread only, to facilitate "silent-upload" mode, and can be restricted in terms of its maximum memory-footprint size.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Added serializable attributes to custom exceptions, and removed unnecessary references.</releaseNotes>
